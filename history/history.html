		<p><strong>Pre-Incan cultures</strong></p>
		<p>The Moche people frequently placed llamas and llama parts in the burials of important people, as offerings or provisions for the afterlife.[30] The Moche culture of pre-Columbian Peru depicted llamas quite realistically in their ceramics.</p>
		<p><strong>Inca empire</strong></p>
		<p>In the Inca empire, llamas were the only beasts of burden, and many of the people dominated by the Inca had long traditions of llama herding. For the Inca nobility, the llama was of symbolic significance, and llama figures were often buried with the dead.[31] In South America, llamas are still used as beasts of burden, as well as for the production of fiber and meat.</p>
		<p>The Inca deity Urcuchillay was depicted in the form of a multicolored llama.</p>
		<p>Scholar Alex Chepstow-Lusty has argued that the switch from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to widespread agriculture was only possible because of the use of llama dung as fertilizer.</p>
		<p><strong>Spanish empire</strong></p>
		<p>One of the main uses for llamas at the time of the Spanish conquest was to bring down ore from the mines in the mountains.[35] Gregory de Bolivar estimated that in his day, as many as 300 thousand were employed in the transport of produce from the Potosí mines alone, but since the introduction of horses, mules, and donkeys, the importance of the llama as a beast of burden has greatly diminished.</p>
		<p>According to Juan Ignacio Molina, the Dutch captain Joris van Spilbergen observed the use of chilihueques (possibly a llama type) by native Mapuches of Mocha Island as plow animals in 1614.</p>
